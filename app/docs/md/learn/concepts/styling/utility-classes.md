Utility classes are an optimized way to apply general styling.
They remove large amounts of duplication from your stylesheets and lend visual harmony to your app.
Utility class stylesheets tend to be tiny — around ~30k on disk and 9k over the wire.

## Styleguide

As a basis of styleguides, utility classes are unparalleled in providing a usable system for developers and a cohesive appearance to your users.

## Ready to go

Enhance comes preconfigured with a [customizable utility class system](https://github.com/enhance-dev/enhance-styles#readme).
During development a stylesheet is generated and served via `/enhance-styles.css` and included by default in your document's `<head>` section.

<doc-callout level="caution">

If you use a [custom Head function](/docs/learn/starter-project/head), `enhance-styles.css` will **not** be included by default.
To add Enhance Styles utility classes with a custom `head.mjs`, it is recommended to use the helper function [described below](#getstyles) to include Enhance Styles.

</doc-callout>

## Usage

Apply utility classes to your element markup

```javascript
export default function MyParagraph({ html }) {
  return html`
    <p class="font-serif p1 mb-1">
      <slot></slot>
    </p>
  `
}
```

## Logical properties

Enhance Styles' utility class system makes use of [CSS logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties), which account for every flavor of [writing mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Writing_Modes), as opposed to just left to right (LTR).

For those who are used to thinking of CSS properties with physical directions (e.g. `margin-top`), getting used to logical properties (e.g. `margin-block-start`) can take some work, but we believe it’s an extremely worthwhile practice. This also makes Enhance Styles well suited for designers and developers working in writing modes other than LTR, or even with multiple writing modes.

The table below provides a quick comparison between the logical directions and their physical equivalents in LTR.

| Logical direction | Equivalent in LTR |
|-|-|
| block | top + bottom |
| block-start | top |
| block-end | bottom |
| inline | left + right |
| inline-start | left |
| inline-end | right |

These logical properties are also accounted for in our class naming. For example:

| Class | Effect | Equivalent in LTR |
|-|-|-|
| `.mi-auto` | `margin-inline: auto` | `margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto` |
| `.pbe<N>` | `padding-block-end: <N>` | `padding-bottom: <N>` |
| `.inset-be-0` | `inset-block-end: 0` | `bottom: 0` |

## `generated.css`

Enhance Styles stores a copy of generated styles at the root `/.enhance/generated.css`.
This file can be used as a helpful reference for class names available to your HTML.

We're working on providing a dynamic, project-specific styleguide that will contain this reference. Stay tuned 📡

<doc-callout slim mark="😶‍🌫️">

This `/.enhance` directory should be ignored from your project's version control.

</doc-callout>

## Customize

It is possible to completely customize your project's utility classes.
To do so you will need to do two things:

### 1. JSON config file

Add a `styleguide.json` (or choose another name) file to the root of your project.

<doc-link-callout link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enhance-dev/enhance-styles/main/config.json" mark="📄">
  Copy this one to get started
</doc-link-callout>

### 2. Update `.arc`

Edit your project's `.arc` file to tell it where to grab the config.
Add these lines at the bottom of your `.arc` file in the root of your project.

```arc
@enhance-styles
config styleguide.json
```

## `getStyles`

By default Enhance Styles is automatically included in HTML documents rendered by Enhance.
However, you may want to include these utility classes elsewhere or in a [custom Head function](/docs/learn/starter-project/head).

A utility function is provided to access your generated stylesheet.

```javascript
import { getStyles } from '@enhance/arc-plugin-styles'

const styles = getStyles.all()

styles.link    // a <link rel="stylesheet"> tag
styles.style   // a <style> tag for inline styles
styles.path    // root-relative path to the .css file
```

Furthermore, individual methods can be imported:

```javascript
import { getStyles } from '@enhance/arc-plugin-styles'

getStyles.linkTag()   // a <link rel="stylesheet"> tag
getStyles.styleTag()  // a <style> tag for inline styles
getStyles.path()      // root-relative path to the .css file
```

<doc-callout level="info">

Though `@enhance/arc-plugin-styles` is already a dependency of Enhance, you may want to declare it as a direct dependency of your project:

<div class="mt-1">

```bash
npm i @enhance/arc-plugin-styles
```

</div>
